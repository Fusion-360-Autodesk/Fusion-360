## 🧠 Overview  

**Fusion 360** is a unified platform that brings together design, engineering, and manufacturing workflows into a single application. Built for modern Windows systems, it supports the entire product development cycle—from early concepts to production-ready outputs.

The software combines parametric and direct modeling, enabling precise control alongside flexible iteration. Designers can refine geometry, explore alternatives, and manage revisions without leaving the workspace. Integrated analysis tools help validate designs early by simulating real-world behavior and constraints.

Fusion 360 also streamlines manufacturing preparation. Built-in tools support CNC machining workflows and additive manufacturing, allowing teams to transition smoothly from design to fabrication. Cloud-based collaboration features help keep projects synchronized and teams aligned.

Fusion 360 delivers an efficient, end-to-end environment for creators who value speed, accuracy, and continuity.
